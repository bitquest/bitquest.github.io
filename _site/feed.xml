        <title>BitQuest 2</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/tqZEwpL.png&quot; alt=&quot;Satoshi Town, also known as &amp;quot;the spawn&amp;quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new BitQuest, version 2.0 is finished. The goal of this release was to make the integration of Bitcoin into Minecraft simple, open, and hackable. I am sure this is far from perfect, but a really fun new way to play Minecraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s go ahead and tell you what’s new and different!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;on-chain-wallets&quot;&gt;On-Chain wallets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/UM6nLpU.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;My Wallet&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before 2.0, we were accounting player’s balance ‘off chain’: A database of debits, credits, and balances. The good side of this, is we can handle a huge amount of transactions, because we didn’t need to upload every one of them to the Blockchain, which induces fees and confirmation time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with that solution is that we have to keep track of every transaction, secure and segregate wallets, and produce checks for potencial duplications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now use “on chain” transactions, which means everything is uploaded to the Blockchain and all the information about the server economy is out there in the open for everyone to account for where the money is, and where it goes (more on that later).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having an on chain wallet also means you can do player-to-player transactions without the server being the middleman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bad side is transactions are a little slow, there’s a limit on how many we can do and sometimes you have to wait confirmation times to spend bits. There are a number of Bitcoin enhancements coming in the future that will make things better, and we are looking into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To handle all transactions, we use the excellent tools of our friends at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blockcypher.com&quot;&gt;BlockCypher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-markets-and-loot&quot;&gt;New Markets and Loot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/jmUsfeg.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Buying diamond and Elytra&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Satoshi Town you can buy valuable stuff with Bitcoin, like food or the latest Elytra wings. Each comes at a different price, though. But the interesting part is what happens to the Bitcoin spent in items!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All Market transactions go to a “World” wallet. Each time a monster is killed, a small number of calculations (and luck) might substract 200 bits from that wallet directly to yours, a small reward for your braveness. If you choose to spend that money again inside the Market, it will go back to the world wallet, rewarding another player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the transactions are now on-chain, you can look into the world wallet and explore the raw operations of the game economy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
https://blockchain.info/address/1BiWdDaHChaKTcNXWs3nxPRcxb6CHM5h2u
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;land-ownership&quot;&gt;Land Ownership&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/4dfEhu2.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Extending the empire&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past BitQuest, land was free but ubiquitous. So many players claimed plots and never got back, leaving construction projects unfinished and deadly traps; Also, the community was growing and server space shrinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this new version, a land “chunk” of 16x16 blocks can be bought at the price of 200 bits (or 0.0002BTC); This transaction goes straight to the administrator as a contribution for server maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can claim contiguous chunks to make big areas, even cities!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bitquest-is-also-a-plugin&quot;&gt;BitQuest is also a plugin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you can play BitQuest in &lt;a href=&quot;http://bitquest.co&quot;&gt;the official server&lt;/a&gt;, the project was re-written from scratch as a plug-in just because a single, but very important goal: To allow anyone to make their own Minecraft Bitcoin servers. It matches the latest &lt;a href=&quot;http://spigotmc.com&quot;&gt;Spigot&lt;/a&gt; API and compatible with Mac/PC/Linux vanilla Minecraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, it’s a little rough and undocumented but very soon we’ll have JAR and Docker Image in line with last stable BitQuest for deployment with minimum configuration. We hope this attracts collaborators as well expand the Bitcoin gaming universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;open-source&quot;&gt;Open Source&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that inside the next generation of virtual worlds, money will be an inter-operable, open, transparent asset backed by the Blockchain, like Bitcoin. A game money we can spend outside a specific world, perhaps in other games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assets bought inside video games, like weapons or land ownership should be stored on the blockchain, and players must have freedom to sell or barter those assets inside or outside the system without restrictions or fees, just like any real world stuff you buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is so much work to do and BitQuest is just a tiny fraction. This release would be impossible without the help of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/shallonhackenb1&quot;&gt;Airiellis&lt;/a&gt;, Burntone, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Xeyler&quot;&gt;Xeyler&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/juanj&quot;&gt;juanj&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/RagingMouser&quot;&gt;RagingMouser&lt;/a&gt; and everyone on the BitQuest slack team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BitQuest plugin is open source that you can fork or contribute on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bitquest/bitquest&quot;&gt;Github repo&lt;/a&gt;, And if you want to support BitQuest even further, your donations are appreciated:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>BitQuest is now Open Source</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;BitQuest started as an experiment to create a Bitcoin economy inside Minecraft and we have not only demonstrated how Bitcoin and Blockchain technology can be best game money in the world, but started the best community of players and collaborators we could ever hope for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re excited to announce that BitQuest 2.0 Beta testing has started, This is a complete rewrite of the project that works as a Spigot plugin, and completely Open Source under the Apache-2.0 License.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can check the official repository here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bitquest/bitquest&quot;&gt;https://github.com/bitquest/bitquest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means the game mechanics and economy are completely transparent, we’ll be open to collaborations via pull requests to improve the game, everyone is welcome to fork and make their own Minecraft servers fuelled with the power of Bitcoin as an in-game economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to thank the folks at &lt;a href=&quot;http://xapo.com&quot;&gt;Xapo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blockcypher.com&quot;&gt;BlockCypher&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Xeyler&quot;&gt;Xeyler&lt;/a&gt;, the BitQuest Slack and &lt;a href=&quot;http://mego.cl&quot;&gt;Mego&lt;/a&gt; for helping on this huge re-launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re hoping to see you on the brand new BitQuest.
Merry Christmas!!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>BitQuest 2.0 is coming soon</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi fellow BitQuesters!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve been quiet for a period of a few months, and we are deeply sorry for all of you guys who felt abandoned, but the time has come to re structure this project and find the best way to achieve the great ideas we have for this server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past 2 months we’ve been writing the server code from scratch, which was a arduous task to implement a new design. We all know that BitQuest 1.0 had a lot of bugs and problems with Bitcoin and most of the problems originate due to the very fact that the Minecraft engine is not designed to handle any type of in-game currency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the past year we have come up with a strategy to make the server a lot more stable and easier to mantain, however, this new design requires completely different technology and the need to rewrite most of the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also learnt that there is a lot of people who want to support the project via donations, code contributions and lending free servers and we think the best vehicle to allow contibutions, transparency and resillience to the project is to make it open source. That way the contributions will help not only make BitQuest the best Minecraft server in the world, also allowing other people to make their own BitQuests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From now on, all the game code resides on &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/bitquest/bitquest&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, so we can all keep track of the development process and (more importantly) get involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe Bitcoin is gonna be the official currency of virtual worlds, hands down. And while still in its infancy, this is the time to experiment integrating this new technology and keeping BitQuest closed is not a cool way to contribute to the Bitcoin community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, My main task will be to help new developers get started by documenting the code and tools, creating spaces for discussion of the future of the project and keeping a transparent, organized, democratic organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, my company (&lt;a href=&quot;http://mego.cl&quot;&gt;MEGO&lt;/a&gt;) will be sponsoring this project with production, testing and development servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m very excited for the future of this project, but it will come faster and greater with a bigger team. If you want to join the moderators or dev team, please drop me a line at cristian@mego.cl&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for playing!&lt;/p&gt;
