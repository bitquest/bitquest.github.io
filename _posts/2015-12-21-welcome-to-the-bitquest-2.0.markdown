Santa has come to Satoshi Town with a special surprise!!

We’re excited to announce that BitQuest is now available as an open source Minecraft Spigot Plugin. The first plugin ever to integrate Bitcoin as an in-game currency. You can check the official repository here: https://github.com/bitquest/bitquest

BitQuest started as a side project by explodi to create an unique Minecraft server with a Bitcoin-denominated economy, where players could buy, sell and trade items using BTC micropayments. One year later, we had quite a run, 324 commits, more than 6 BTC delivered to players, and a very loyal fanbase. We cannot be more excited, but we’re also curious about where it goes when are more people involved on the codebase. So we decide to put an extra effort to clean the code and open source BitQuest as a Spigot plugin with a MIT license.

Now you can run your own BitQuest server with your personal Bitcoin wallet as the main reserve, and build Minecraft realms fuelled with the power of Bitcoin as an in-game currency.

For our current (and new) players this means:

We will be still be hosting the main BitQuest server where you can check the shiny new features. But now there will be two servers: “The Classic” (play.bitquest.co), current server “The Beta” (beta.bitquest.co) who runs the last version. We encourage everyone to play the beta server and give us feedback about bugs or new features you would love to see. The gameplay have been streamlined, Banks and emerald blocks have been deprecated. Players get BTC loot directly (through blockchain transactions) from killing mobs. You can register your own terrain to avoid griefing to your buildings placing a sign with the name of the area, this will cost you 20 bits, and you can expand the terrain placing adjacent signs with the same name. Next year, we’ll be deprecating the classic server in favour of the last version. We haven’t any schedule for this, but we’ll be notifying before it happens to our players through the BitQuest Chronicle Newsletter and the subreddit.

We’re also making public the BitQuest main site through Github Pages. If you’re a web developer and want to contribute to our current site, feel free too fork the Jekyll repository: https://github.com/bitquest/bitquest.github.io

We want to thank Xeyler, the BitQuest Slack and Mego for helping on this re-launch.

We’re hoping to see you on the brand new BitQuest.

Merry Christmas from Satoshi Town!!
