Hello Bitquest community! 

We are happy to announce a new beta update: PETS! 

For 100 bits you can adopt a fluffy furry bestial friend: an ocelot.  It might follow you around chunks and spawns with you every time you die lol.

If you want to own a kitty, use the command 

<code class="highlighter-rouge">
/pet &lt;nameofyourpet&gt;
</code>

 It works in both servers: **play.bitquest.co** and **doge.bitquest.co** 

Anyway, this is a beta feature and is not finished yet, so expect your new friend to be a little glitchy.

**If you adopt more than one kitty, the last one will be yours. The others will be released to freedom!** 

We want to improve this feature in the next versions with ideas from the community. Please share your ideas through our channels ;D 

Thank you for playing!
