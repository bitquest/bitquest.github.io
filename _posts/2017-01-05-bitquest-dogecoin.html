<p>Hi fellow BitQuesters!!</p>

<p>Dogecoin is a notable cryptocurrency. It’s a clone of an old version the Bitcoin network, with one difference: it inflates at a rapid pace with no limit.</p>

<p>Since Bitcoin entered the mainstream and became less accesible, players have asking us to open alternative servers in other cryptocurrencies, so we decided to experiment with Dogecoin.</p>

<p>Please note this server is considered “alpha testing” and we recommend you don’t use it to store large amount of coins.</p>

<p>After a small refaction of the BitQuest code, it’s finally compatible with Dogecoin and you can connect to our brand new doge server in:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">doge.bitquest.co</code></p>

<p><em>(Using Minecraft: Java Edition 1.12)</em></p>

<p>Like always, is possible to use our open source code to create your own dogecoin server! <a href="https://github.com/bitquest/bitquest">you can learn more in our GitHub repo</a></p>

<p>About the Bitcoin server… Worry not! There’s no plan to discontinue or replace the world of BitQuest, and both will be receiving the same updates.</p>
