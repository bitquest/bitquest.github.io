**How do I communicate in game?**

To speak in local just press t to bring up the chat and start typing.
To speak in global use ! Before whatever you want to say.
To emote type `/me` followed by what you’re doing.
To speak privately with another player the command is `/tell <playername> <message>`.  For example to privately say hello to me you’d type `/tell SatoshiSpinster Hello`.
A handy shortcut to names in game: if the person you’re referencing is online when you type the first few letters of their name and then the tab key it should auto-populate the name.  For example if you were going to say hello to me privately you could just type `/tell sat` [press the tab key] => `/tell SatoshiSpinster`.

**How do I get BTC?**

Kill mobs.  If there is loot in the loot wallet and you get lucky (it’s a rare drop) you’ll get a drop.
You can also get BTC in game by transferring it in or trading with other players.
On BitQuest you have a wallet.  It can be accessed with the /wallet command.
To transfer to other people in game you would type /send <the amount in bits> <player name or BTC address> for example if you were going to send bits to me in game you would type /send 100 SatoshiSpinster

**How do I purchase land?**

You will need to have 200 bits in your in game wallet.  Each 100 bit purchase buys one chunk which is a 16 by 16 square.  You can see where a chunk is by pressing f3 + g or fn + f3 + g on laptop.  When you have decided which chunk you want place a sign anywhere on that chunk with ^Name you want^

**Why can’t I sell stuff to villagers?**

You cannot sell stuff to villagers because they are the primary way the loot wallet gets funds.  Anything you buy from the villagers goes into the loot wallet.  The loot wallet can be viewed or donated to at https://blockchain.info/address/1BiWdDaHChaKTcNXWs3nxPRcxb6CHM5h2u

**I’m new, can someone help me?**

We are, in general, a cooperative group.  Although you don’t start with anything there are usually some things we, as players, maintain to help new folks.  On the West side of town there is a golden sword dispenser to help you on your way.  If it is empty please let someone know.
There is also a sharing farm a little bit West of town and others scattered around.  If you grab some food from any public farm please take the time to replant it for the next person.
Keep inventory is turned on so if you die you will not lose the stuff you’re carrying.  You also don’t lose levels BUT it takes a lot longer to level then vanilla servers.
