Because fesworks posted this on reddit, I'm copy pasting and re-posting this here:
Since Many people may have alts, it may be helpful to transfer land claims:

**Transfer Land Claim - Using Sign: ^transfer PLAYERNAME^**
* "playername" must be case-sensitive.
* "^" in front of "transfer"
* Must have a SPACE after "transfer"
* "^" at end of the playername
* NOTE: you can use LINEBREAKS, but do not forget the SPACE, which needs to be after "^transfer " before the linebreak, or before " PLAYERNAME" after the linebreak.

**Changing the name of a Land Claim - Using Sign: ^Name of Claim^**
* "^" in front of the first word
* Do not forget to put SPACES before, or after, using a LINEBREAKÂ¹
* "^" at end of the last word.
* NOTE: A LINEBREAK is not counted as a SPACE. A LINEBREAK is when you press enter to go to next line:

`"^This is a "`
`"long name for"`
`" my claimed land^"`

`--- [This is a long name for my claimed land]`

`versus`
`"^This is a"`
`"long name for"`
`"my claimed land^"`

`--- [This is along name formy claimed land]`
