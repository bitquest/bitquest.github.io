# Protecting / Claiming Land
In BitQuest, [chunks](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Chunk) ("plots" that are 16x16 blocks) are sold at 100 bits each. (Worth about 25 cents at the time of writing) Unlike [[buying in the market|The Market]], bits spent on claiming land are considered donations, and they're spent towards server expenses.

To claim a chunk, you must place a sign in the desired chunk, surrounding the desired name of the plot with a caret(^) as shown here:

![this place is now part of the great empire of explodia](http://i.giphy.com/3o6EhMIYvbn07cBK8w.gif)

If your desired name is too long to fit in one line of the sign, you may use multiple lines.  Make sure to put the caret at the start and end of the name of your chunk, not at the start and end of the line.

Please note: Plots are aligned in a grid with chunks, they aren't aligned around the sign. To see the grid in-game, press F3 + G (Or FN + F3 + G on some computers).

You can also claim land via commands:
```
/land claim <desired plot name>
```
*Note* Command claims do not support spaces
# Land Permissions

Once you have claimed a chunk, you can choose who is able to edit it.  Your land can be public, private, or it can be edited within your clan.

```
/land permission [public,private,clan]
```
