Protecting / Claiming Land
--------------------------
In BitQuest, [chunks](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Chunk) ("plots" that are 16x16 blocks) are sold at 100 bits in ```play.bitquest.co``` or 100 DOGE in ```doge.bitquest.co``` each.  All bits spent on claiming land are [donations](/wiki/donations.html), and they're spent towards server expenses.


Please note: Plots are aligned in a grid with chunks, they aren't aligned around the sign. To see the grid in-game, press F3 + G (Or FN + F3 + G on some computers).

You can also claim land via commands:
```
/land claim <desired plot name>
```
*Note* Command claims do not support spaces
# Land Permissions

Once you have claimed a chunk, you can choose who is able to edit it.  Your land can be public, private, or it can be edited within your clan.

```
/land permission [public,private,clan]
```
